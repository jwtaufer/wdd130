   <h2>Jake</h2>
   <p>I'm pursuing a degree in Software Development. I'm married, have two children and a golden retriever, and am currently a stay at home dad while my wife works as a nurse. I used to paint houses for a living, but my wife makes more money as a nurse, so we've switched roles for a bit until I'm done with school. After that I'm hoping to do some free-lance work as a web developer or a software engineer. </p>
