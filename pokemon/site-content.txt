Hello there! Welcome to the world of POKEMON! My name is OAK! People call me the POKEMON PROF!

This world is inhabited by creatures called POKEMON! For some people, POKEMON are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself... I study POKEMON as a profession.

Oh right! I have a request of you. On the desk there is my invention, POKEDEX! It automatically records data on POKEMON you've seen or caught! It's a hi-tech encyclopedia!

To make a complete guide on all the POKEMON in the world... That was my dream! But, I'm too old! I can't do it! So, I want you to fulfill my dream for me! Get moving! This is a great undertaking in POKEMON history!

POKEMON around the world wait for you!

POKEMON RED & BLUE:

Pokemon Red & Pokemon Blue were the first of many Pokemon games to be released in the west in 1998. They followed after their eastern counterparts "Pocket Monsters: Red," "Pocket Monsters: Green" and "Pocket Monsters: Blue," the last of which was the base for the international version we know here in the west.
